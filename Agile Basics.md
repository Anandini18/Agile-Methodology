# Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding principles for software development that values :

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

# 12 Agile Principles

1. **Deliver Value Faster** – Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. **Welcome Change** – Welcome changes to requirements, even late in projects. Agile processes harness that change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. **Deliver Working Software Frequently** – Working software should be delivered after a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. **Work Together Daily** – Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. **Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals** – Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

6. **Face-to-Face Conversations** – The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is with face-to-face conversation.

7. **Working Software is Key** – Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. **Sustainable Development** – Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, project team members (developers), and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. **Attention to Technical Excellence** – Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. **Simplicity** – The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

11. **Self-Organizing Teams** – The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. **Reflect and Adjust** – At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

**Estimation in Agile:**
- Agile estimation is like guessing how long it will take to finish a puzzle or reach a destination.
- It helps teams plan and prioritize work by breaking it into manageable pieces.

**Techniques:**
1. **Bus (Big, Uncertain, Small):**
   - Imagine tasks as different types of buses: big ones take longer, uncertain ones have unclear routes, and small ones are quick and simple.
   - For example, building a website might be a big bus, while fixing a typo is a small bus.
   
2. **T-Shirt Sizes:**
   - Think of tasks like different sizes of T-shirts: small, medium, large, and extra-large.
   - This helps teams quickly categorize tasks based on complexity.
   
3. **Fibonacci Sequence (Story Points):**
   - Story points are like levels in a video game: harder levels take more time and effort to complete.
   - Using Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) helps teams assign relative values to tasks.

**Other Agile Roles:**
1. **Product Sponsor:**
   - The product sponsor is like the captain of a ship, steering the project in the right direction.
   - They provide guidance and support to ensure the project meets its goals.

2. **Business Leaders:**
   - Business leaders are like coaches, motivating the team and ensuring alignment with business objectives.
   - They make decisions and set priorities based on the company's vision and goals.

3. **Technology Leaders:**
   - Technology leaders are like mechanics, ensuring that the project's technical aspects run smoothly.
   - They provide expertise and guidance on technology choices and implementation.

4. **Agile Detractors (Leadership):**
   - Agile detractors are like skeptics who question the effectiveness of agile methods.
   - Leadership plays a crucial role in addressing concerns and promoting agile values and practices.

5. **Subject Matter Expert/Senior User:**
   - Subject matter experts are like teachers, sharing their knowledge and insights to help the team make informed decisions.
   - They provide expertise in specific domains or areas of the project.

6. **Business User:**
   - Business users are like customers, providing feedback and requirements to ensure the product meets their needs.
   - They play a key role in defining and validating project deliverables.

7. **Agile Coach:**
   - Agile coaches are like mentors, guiding teams through the agile journey and helping them overcome challenges.
   - They provide training, support, and encouragement to foster a culture of continuous improvement.
