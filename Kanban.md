# **Kanban Framework**

**What is Kanban Framework?**
- Kanban is a visual framework used for managing work and workflow.
- It originated from Toyota's production system as a method for optimizing manufacturing processes and inventory control.
- Kanban has since been adapted for various industries and contexts, including software development, project management, and knowledge work.

**"Kanban is about stop starting, start finishing"**
- This phrase emphasizes the importance of completing existing tasks before taking on new ones, thus preventing work overload and improving efficiency.
- It encourages teams to focus on finishing tasks in progress rather than constantly starting new ones.

**Toyota Started It**
- Kanban was developed by Toyota as part of its lean manufacturing principles in the 1940s and 1950s.
- The system was aimed at minimizing waste, optimizing production, and improving efficiency in manufacturing processes.

**Four Fundamental Principles of Kanban:**
1. **Visualize the Workflow:**
   - Kanban promotes visualizing the workflow by representing tasks and their statuses on a Kanban board.
   - Example: Using a physical or digital board with columns representing different stages of work (e.g., to-do, in progress, done).

2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):**
   - Kanban advocates setting limits on the number of tasks allowed in each stage of the workflow.
   - Example: Establishing a WIP limit of 3 tasks for the "in progress" column on a Kanban board to prevent overloading team members.

3. **Manage Flow:**
   - Kanban focuses on optimizing the flow of work through the system by reducing bottlenecks and delays.
   - Example: Ensuring that tasks move smoothly from one stage to another without unnecessary delays or interruptions.

4. **Make Process Policies Explicit:**
   - Kanban encourages making the rules, policies, and guidelines governing the workflow explicit and transparent.
   - Example: Clearly defining the criteria for moving tasks between columns and communicating these guidelines to team members.

**Kanban Board:**
- A Kanban board is a visual representation of the workflow, typically divided into columns representing different stages of work.
- Examples include using Trello or Jira to create digital Kanban boards, where tasks are represented as cards that can be moved between columns based on their status.

**Kanban Cards:**
- Kanban cards represent individual tasks or work items on the Kanban board.
- They contain information such as task descriptions, assignees, due dates, and current status.
- Example: A Kanban card in a software development project might include details about a specific feature or bug fix.

**Six General Practices of Kanban:**
1. **Visualize the Workflow**
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**
3. **Manage Flow**
4. **Make Process Policies Explicit**
5. **Implement Feedback Loops**
6. **Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally**

**Kanban Key Metrics:**
- **Lead Time:** The time taken for a work item to move from request to completion.
- **Cycle Time:** The time taken for a work item to move through the workflow from start to finish.
- Example: Calculating the lead time for a customer support ticket from the time it's submitted to when it's resolved.

**Kanban Metrics Based on Board Type:**
- Different types of Kanban boards may track metrics such as throughput, cycle time, and WIP limits to measure and improve performance.
- Example: Analyzing the cycle time for software development tasks on a Kanban board to identify areas for improvement and optimize workflow.

**Kanban Statuses:**
- Kanban boards typically include statuses or columns representing different stages of the workflow.
- Examples include backlog, to-do, in progress, review, and done.

**Kanban Swimlanes:**
- Swimlanes are horizontal categorizations on a Kanban board used to group tasks or work items based on criteria such as team, priority, or project phase.
- Example: Using swimlanes to separate tasks by project or assignee to visualize workload distribution and prioritize tasks effectively.

**Three Steps to Implement Kanban:**
1. **Visualize Your Work:**
   - Map out the workflow and create a Kanban board to visualize the stages of work.
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):**
   - Set WIP limits for each stage to prevent overloading and optimize flow.
3. **Adapt, Monitor, and Improve:**
   - Continuously monitor performance metrics, gather feedback, and adapt the Kanban system to improve efficiency over time.
