# Scrum Framework

## What is Scrum?
Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.

## Three Pillars of Scrum
1. **Transparency**: All aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
2. **Inspection**: Scrum artifacts and progress are inspected frequently to detect any variances.
3. **Adaptation**: If an inspection reveals that one or more aspects of the process deviate outside acceptable limits, adjustments are made as soon as possible.

## Scrum Values
Scrum is built on five core values:
- **Commitment**: Team members commit to achieving the goals of the sprint and the organization.
- **Courage**: Team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the sprint and the goals of the team.
- **Openness**: Team members are open about their work and any challenges they face.
- **Respect**: Team members respect each other to be capable, independent, and respected individuals.

## Three Scrum Elements
### Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner**: Represents stakeholders, defines the product backlog, and prioritizes it.
- **Development Team**: Self-organizing and cross-functional; they deliver potentially shippable increments at the end of each sprint.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures that the team adheres to Scrum practices.

### Scrum Events
- **Sprint**: A time-boxed iteration, typically 2-4 weeks long, during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.
- **Sprint Planning**: The team plans the work to be done in the sprint.
- **Daily Scrum or Daily Standup**: A 15-minute daily meeting where the Development Team synchronizes activities and plans for the next 24 hours.
- **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and receives feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Also held at the end of the sprint, the team reflects on the past sprint and identifies areas for improvement.

### Scrum Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: An ordered list of all desired work for the product, maintained by the Product Owner.
- **Sprint Backlog**: The subset of items from the product backlog selected for the sprint.
- **Product Increment**: The sum of all the completed product backlog items at the end of a sprint.

## User Story in Scrum

### What is an User Story ?
A User Story is a concise, informal description of a feature, told from the perspective of an end user or customer. It serves as a placeholder for a conversation about the user's needs and desires.

### Components of a User Story:
1. **Card**: A physical or digital representation of the user story.
2. **Conversation**: Discussion between the development team and stakeholders about the details of the user story.
3. **Confirmation**: Criteria that define when a user story is complete and done.

### Characteristics:
- **User-Centric**: Written from the perspective of the end user.
- **Simple Language**: Easy to understand by all stakeholders.
- **Focused on Value**: Emphasizes the value the feature brings to the user or customer.
- **Independent and Negotiable**: Can be worked on independently and is open to negotiation between the team and the product owner.

### Format:
"As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

### Example:
"As a website visitor, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Clear, specific conditions that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.
- Written collaboratively by the team and stakeholders.
- Should be testable with clear pass/fail results.
- Usually 3 to 7 acceptance criteria per user story are recommended.

### Example User Story and Acceptance Criteria
**User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to log in to the system.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. User can enter username and password.
  2. System validates user credentials.
  3. User gains access upon successful validation.

### Writing Great User Stories Using INVEST
- **Independent**: User stories should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.
- **Negotiable**: Details of the user story can be negotiated between the team and the product owner.
- **Valuable**: Each user story should deliver value to the user or customer.
- **Estimatable**: The team should be able to estimate the size of a user story.
- **Small**: User stories should be small enough to fit within a single sprint.
- **Testable**: User stories should have clear acceptance criteria that can be used to determine when they are complete.

### Importance:
- User stories drive the development process in an agile environment.
- They promote collaboration and understanding between the development team and stakeholders.
- Help prioritize work based on user needs and business value.

### Iterative Nature:
- User stories evolve over time as more information becomes available.
- They may be refined, reprioritized, split, or merged based on feedback and changing requirements.

### Role of Product Owner:
- Responsible for creating and prioritizing user stories based on the product vision and stakeholder needs.
- Works closely with the development team to ensure clarity and understanding of user story requirements.

### Role of Development Team:
- Responsible for estimating, implementing, and testing user stories.
- Collaborates with the product owner to refine user stories and clarify requirements.

### Role of Scrum Master:
- Facilitates discussions around user stories during sprint planning, daily scrums, and sprint reviews.
- Ensures that user stories are appropriately prioritized and understood by the team.

## Working Agreements

Working agreements are a set of guidelines or rules that the Scrum Team creates and agrees upon to ensure effective collaboration, transparency, and productivity throughout the project. 
These agreements help establish shared expectations and norms for how the team operates.

- **Ready**: Criteria that a user story must meet before it can be taken into a sprint.
- **Done**: Criteria that define when a user story or task is complete.

## Product Increment
- The sum of all completed product backlog items at the end of a sprint.
- It should be potentially shippable, meeting the team's definition of "done."

## Burndown Chart
- A graphical representation of work remaining versus time.
- It helps the team track progress and meet sprint goals.

## Burn Up Chart
- A graphical representation of work completed over time.
- It shows the total work completed and any scope changes over time.

## Responsible for Completing Burndown and Burn Up Charts
- Typically, the Scrum Master or a designated team member is responsible for maintaining and updating the burndown and burn up charts.
- It's essential to keep them up-to-date to provide visibility into the team's progress.
