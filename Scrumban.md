# **Scrumban Framework**

## What is Scrumban ?

**Scrum + Kanban = Scrumban:**
- Scrumban is like combining two different superheroes, Scrum and Kanban, to make one powerful team.
- It takes the best parts of Scrum's structure and Kanban's flexibility to create a balanced way of working.

## **Features of Scrumban:**
- **Flexibility:** It lets teams adapt quickly to changes, just like changing lanes in traffic.
- **Visual Management:** Teams use boards to see work moving, like watching a train moving along tracks.
- **Continuous Improvement:** It's all about getting better over time, just like practicing a sport to become a pro.
- **Time Management:** It helps teams stick to schedules and deadlines, similar to setting alarms to wake up on time.

## **Continuous Flow in Scrumban:**
- Imagine a river that keeps flowing smoothly without any big dams blocking it.
- In Scrumban, work flows steadily from start to finish without getting stuck, just like a river flowing freely.

## **Timebox:**
- Think of timeboxing as putting tasks in neat little boxes with clear start and end times.
- It's like setting a timer for each activity, such as a 30-minute reading session or a 1-hour workout.

## **Triage & Feature Freeze:**
- Triage is like sorting tasks by urgency, just like doctors prioritize patients in an emergency room.
- Feature freeze means no more changes allowed during a certain time, similar to pausing a game to catch a breath before playing again.

## **Who is the Target Audience?:**
- Scrumban is great for teams who want the best of both worlds: structure and flexibility.
- It suits teams who need to juggle changing priorities and still deliver quality work, just like chefs who adapt recipes based on available ingredients.
